3. Unit tests by JUnit, testing if your functions are performing as expected

To view feedback go to the Actions tab above and click on the lastest workflow. 

Click on the left sidebar on "checkstyle" to view the Checkstyle report. 

Click "misspell" to view found mispellings. 

Scroll to the bottom and download the artifact to view your detailed test report. 
It will show your current score on the assignment based on the tests we've written. 

Incorporate this feedback into your code. Fix code style errors, misspellings, and code logic that is causing
unit test failures. 

Reupload your code and test again! 

Keep going until all tests are passed.
