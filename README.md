## CSS143_YoungHumanV2

This repository contains starter code for your assignment. 

Download them and edit them in your IDE according to assignment directions. 
If you've already started your assignment, just upload your code. 

You'll get 3 kinds of feedback:
1. Checkstyle feedback on code style mistakes in the Google Java Style 
2. Misspell report on detected misspellings in your code and comments
3. Unit tests by JUnit, testing if your functions are performing as expected

To view feedback go to the Actions tab above and click on the lastest workflow. 

## Action
Once you're ready to test them, edit the template files and they will be tested using GitHub Actions. 
This is the action page: <br>
